13345,08HALZ4TFENHR7S4,An Auction Mechanism for Resource Allocation in Mobile Cloud Computing Systems,"A mobile cloud computing system is composed of heterogeneous services and resources to be allocated by the cloud service provider to mobile cloud users. On one hand, some of these resources are substitutable (e. g., users can use storage from different places) that they have similar functions to the users. On the other hand, some resources are complementary that the user will need them as a bundle (e. g., users need both wireless connection and storage for online photo posting). In this paper, we first model the resource allocation process of a mobile cloud computing system as an auction mechanism with premium and discount factors. The premium and discount factors indicate complementary and substitutable relations among cloud resources provided by the service provider. Then, we analyze the individual rationality and incentive compatibility (truthfulness) properties of the users in the proposed auction mechanism. The optimal solutions of the resource allocation and cost charging schemes in the auction mechanism is discussed afterwards.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6176,None,[],2013,0,0,,"15801,23195,57128","Hou-Yang Zhang,Fengping Wang,Dusit Niyato",None,"Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing,Computer Science and Game Theory",None

Auditor place main role of monitoring the data transmission and data manipulations between the data owner and server. We introduced a secure and efficient dynamic auditing protocol by using the File segmentation and distribution, Tag generation, and Random Challenge and verification algorithms. Our proposed approach is efficient than the traditional protocols.",http://www.ijettjournal.org/volume-4/issue-7/IJETT-V4I7P178.pdf,None,english,0,0,1,,124970,K.

2006,018LT5FYF0K5XF0X,An Innovation of an Academic Cloud Computing Service,"Despite the popularity of cloud computing services, few studies have investigated academic cloud computing services. This study explored the innovation of an academic cloud, the Ming Chuan University Cloud System (MCUCS). A cloud computing service provides numerous benefits to an organization. We conducted a comprehensive review and observation of MCUCS and identified 8 benefits for teachers and 10 for students. Teachers and students agreed that MCUCS consistently provided a service that improved their performance. The most beneficial features of MCUCS were its high usage and user satisfaction. Between April 2010 and April 2012, the usage exceeded 878 300 events. Overall student satisfaction with MCUCS was 79.2%, and teacher satisfaction was 86%. We concluded that MCUCS provides a good model of an academic cloud computing service and a high qualified system.",http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?DOI=10.4236/jsea.2012.531108,10.4236/jsea.2012.531108,english,2012,938-943,1,,11594,Wen-Lung Shiau,Journal of Software Engineering and Applications,"Innovation,An Evaluation,Dissatisfaction,Academic Cloud Computing Service,Benefits",Scientific Research Publishing
11408,07824SAVDRPVIAOK,Analyzing the Critical Issues of Mobile Users in Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing has recently emerged as a new paradigm for hosting and delivering services over the Internet. Mobile Cloud Computing is widely accepted as a concept that can significantly improve the user experience when accessing mobile services. By removing the limitations of mobile devices with respect to storage and computing capabilities and providing a new level of security, it is expected that it will find broad acceptance on the business as well as consumer side. This work mainly concentrates to analyze the mobile devices and applications during offloading of services between cloud and devices to save energy. In addition, the minimal path to the cloud servers from mobile devices will be carried out to minimize the network latency.",http://www.enggjournals.com/ijcse/doc/IJCSE13-05-04-027.pdf,None,english,0,0,1,,49703,Geetha Krishnamoorthy,International Journal on Computer Science and Engineering,"Mobile agent,Mobile Cloud Computing,mobile computing",Engg Journals Publications
