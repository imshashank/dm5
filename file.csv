1,0000I3SKQ1BEQMQH,Global Expression Profiling in Atopic Eczema Reveals Reciprocal Expression of Inflammatory and Lipid Genes,"<sec><title>Background</title><p>Atopic eczema (AE) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder. In order to dissect the genetic background several linkage and genetic association studies have been performed. Yet very little is known about specific genes involved in this complex skin disease, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Findings</title><p>We used human DNA microarrays to identify a molecular picture of the programmed responses of the human genome to AE. The transcriptional program was analyzed in skin biopsy samples from lesional and patch-tested skin from AE patients sensitized to <italic>Malassezia sympodialis</italic> (<italic>M. sympodialis</italic>), and corresponding biopsies from healthy individuals. The most notable feature of the global gene-expression pattern observed in AE skin was a reciprocal expression of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes. The overall transcriptional response in <italic>M. sympodialis</italic> patch-tested AE skin was similar to the gene-expression signature identified in lesional AE skin. In the constellation of genes differentially expressed in AE skin compared to healthy control skin, we have identified several potential susceptibility genes that may play a critical role in the pathological condition of AE. Many of these genes, including genes with a role in immune responses, lipid homeostasis, and epidermal differentiation, are localized on chromosomal regions previously linked to AE.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Through genome-wide expression profiling, we were able to discover a distinct reciprocal expression pattern of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes in skin from AE patients. We found a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in AE with cytobands associated to the disease, and furthermore new chromosomal regions were found that could potentially guide future region-specific linkage mapping in AE.

2,0000PETG7PJJ4NGV,From the sandwiched quantum relative Tsallis entropy to its conditional form: Separability criterion beyond local and global spectra,"The quantum relative Renyi entropy of two density matrices was recently extended when the two do not commute, from which a conditional entropy is identified. This is here extended to the corresponding Tsallis relative entropy and to its conditional form. This new expression of Tsallis conditional entropy is shown to witness entanglement beyond the method based on global and local spectra of composite quantum states. When the reduced density matrix happens to be a maximally mixed state, this conditional entropy coincides with the expression in terms of Tsallis entropies derived earlier by Abe and Rajagopal (Physica A 289, 157 (2001)). Separability range in one parameter family of W and GHZ states with 3 and 4 qubits is explored here and it is shown that the results inferred from negative Tsallis conditional entropy matches with that obtained through Peres partial transpose criteria for one-parameter family of W states, in one of its partitions. The criteria is shown to be non-spectral through its usefulness in identifying entanglement in isospectral density matrices.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6944,10.1103/physreva.89.012331,[],2014,0,1,,"A.

Thestudy was conducted through online data base searches, bibliographic surveys in renowned national periodicals and master’s dissertations. Data was collected from July to December 2005, and 13 studies on the subject were selected. It was shown that the majority of the studiesare concentrated in the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. A change was noted in the education of dentists, which pointed out theneed for curricular alterations and teaching directed towards social needs, as well as the integration of teaching and service. From 1992 to 2005, there was a trend towards a predominantly technicist and curative education, transforming it into Dentistry directed largely towards the needs of the population, therefore assuming a more social nature with emphasis on health promotion. This social natureof Dentistry is perfectly suited to the Brazilian reality and it meets the demands of the Law of National Educational Guidelines and Bases/96 and the National Curricular Guidelines, as well as integrating dentists into the reality of the Family Health Program.",http://www.revistargo.com.br/include/getdoc.php?id=3201&article=91&mode=pdf,None,portuguese,0,0,1,,"Maria Eneide Leito de Almeida,Silvia Maria Nbrega-Therrien,Filomena Maria da Costa Pinheiro,Maria Irismar de Almeida",RGO : Revista Gacha de Odontologia,"Brasil,Brazil,dentistry,estudantes de odontologia,students dental",Mundi Brasil Grfica e Editora Ltda.

The architecture has fixed experimental complexity, irrespective of the size of the desired interferometer, whose scale is limited only by fiber and switch loss rates. The architecture employs time-bin encoding, whereby the incident photons form a pulse train, which enters the loops. Dynamically controlled loop coupling ratios allow the construction of the arbitrary linear optics interferometers required for boson-sampling. The architecture employs only a single point of interference and may thus be easier to stabilize than other approaches.

We present the case of an 81-year-old man affected by an acromioclavicular joint cyst, associated to a massive rotator cuff tear, proximal migration of the humeral head and osteoarthritis of the gleno-humeral joint. The mass was 7 × 2.5 cm in size and the overlying skin presented a fistula that drained clear synovial-like fluid. Plain X-ray examination of the left shoulder showed proximal migration of the humeral head migration and osteoarthritis of the gleno-humeral joint, and further MRI evaluation confirmed the clinical diagnosis of a complete rotator cuff tear and observed a large subcutaneous cyst in communication with the degenerative acromioclavicular joint. The patient underwent surgical excision of the cyst and lateral resection of the clavicle to prevent disease recurrence.

SCF action contributes to cell cycle progression but few of the key targets of its action have been identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that expression of the mouse Cul1 (mCul1) in the larval wing disc has a dominant negative effect. It reduces, but does not eliminate, the function of SCF complexes, promotes accumulation of Cubitus interruptus (a target of SCF action), triggers apoptosis, and causes a small wing phenotype. A screen for mutations that dominantly modify this phenotype showed effective suppression upon reduction of E 2 F function, suggesting that compromised downregulation of E 2 F contributes to the phenotype. Partial inactivation of Cul1 delayed the abrupt loss of E 2 F immunofluorescence beyond its normal point of downregulation at the onset of S phase.

13,000837GI48JQPCVK,Heating and Dynamics of Two Flare Loop Systems Observed by AIA and EIS,"We investigate heating and evolution of flare loops in a C 4.7 two-ribbon flare on 2011 February 13. From SDO/AIA imaging observations, we can identify two sets of loops. Hinode/EIS spectroscopic observations reveal blueshifts at the feet of both sets of loops. The evolution and dynamics of the two sets are quite different. The first set of loops exhibits blueshifts for about 25 minutes followed by redshifts, while the second set shows stronger blueshifts, which are maintained for about one hour. The UV 1600 observation by AIA also shows that the feet of the second set of loops brighten twice. These suggest that continuous heating may be present in the second set of loops. We use spatially resolved UV light curves to infer heating rates in the few tens of individual loops comprising the two loop systems. With these heating rates, we then compute plasma evolution in these loops with the ""enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops"" (EBTEL) model. The results show that, for the first set of loops, the synthetic EUV light curves from the model compare favorably with the observed light curves in six AIA channels and eight EIS spectral lines, and the computed mean enthalpy flow velocities also agree with the Doppler shift measurements by EIS. For the second set of loops modeled with twice-heating, there are some discrepancies between modeled and observed EUV light curves in low-temperature bands, and the model does not fully produce the prolonged blueshift signatures as observed. We discuss possible causes for the discrepancies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5056,None,[],2013,0,0,,"Y. Li,J. Qiu,M. D. Ding",None,Solar and Stellar Astrophysics,None

The rats were randomly divided into 4 groups of 5 animal each as vehicle control (2 % tragacanth suspension), standard drug frusemide (20 mg/kg, p. o), and n-butanol extract (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, p. o) treated. Urine was collected in a graduated cylinder and its volume was measured for next 5 hr. Na+, K+ and Cl- concentrations were measured. Phytochemical analysis of A. sativum n-butanol fraction showed presence of steroids, triterpenoidal saponins and carbohydrates. At 20 mg/kg dose onset of diuresis and total volume of urine formed was significantly (P<0.01-0.05) higher. Fifth hour urine volume at 20 mg/kg dose was 9.3 ml as compared to 5.5 ml of control. Extract at 20 mg/kg dose produced 24.57% increase in Na+ excretion against 132.65% increase by frusemide when compared to control signifying natriuretic and aquaretic response.

15,000A66GPGQSDED1Z,Nonstandard approach to gravity for the dark sector of the Universe,"We summarize the present state of research on the darkon fuid as a model for the dark sector of the Universe. Nonrelativistic massless particles are introduced as a realization of the Galilei group in an enlarged phase space. The additional degrees of freedom allow for a nonstandard, minimal coupling to gravity respecting Einstein's equivalence principle. Extended to a self-gravitating fluid the Poisson equation for the gravitational potential contains a dynamically generated effective gravitational mass density of either sign. The equations of motion (EOMs) contain no free parameters and are invariant w. r.t. Milne gauge transformations. Fixing the gauge eliminates the unphysical degrees of freedom. The resulting Lagrangian possesses no free particle limit. The particles it describes, darkons, exist only as fluid particles of a self-gravitating fluid. This darkon fluid realizes the zero-mass Galilean algebra extended by dilations with dynamical exponent z = 5/3. We reduce the EOMs to Friedmann-like equations, derive conserved quantities and a unique Hamiltonian dynamics by implementing dilation symmetry. By the Casimir of the Poisson-bracket (PB)-algebra we foliate the phase space and construct a Lagrangian in reduced phase space. We solve the Friedmann-like equations with the transition redshift and the value of the Casimir as integration constants. We obtain a deceleration phase for the early Universe and an acceleration phase for the late Universe in agreement with observations. Steady state equations in the spherically symmetric case may model a galactic halo. Numerical solutions of a nonlinear diff?erential equation for the gravitational potential lead to predictions for the dark matter (DM) part of the rotation curves (RCs) of galaxies in qualitative agreement with observational data.

Analysis is made both for the periodic Anderson model with the small-dispersive $f$ band and the simplified two parabolic band model in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The magnetic susceptibilities are calculated by using the random phase approximation. It is shown that the maximum value of the magnetic susceptibility perpendicular to the external field is enhanced and yields the anomalous phase boundary. By applying the magnetic field, the phase boundary shifts to higher temperature region in the insulating state with a small band gap.

The leaves were harvested at three period of time viz: 10th (early stage), 15th (Mid stage) and 20th (late stage) week after pruning. The result of the proximate analysis revealed that the early stage has the highest carbohydrate content (55.14%). Mid stage recorded the highest moisture (6.3%) while the late stage has highest protein content (28.08%), crude fiber (10.11%), ash (9.25%), fat (2.5) and pH (6.27). The Phytochemicals detected in both aqueous and methanolic extracts of each of the different stage of leaves maturation were the same except for tannin which was present in aqueous extract but was not detected in methanolic extracts. The detected antinutrients are alkaloids, tannins, phenolics, saponins, flavonoids, steroids while phylobatanin and tripertenes were not. All these results indicate that the leaves harvested at the late stage had a higher percentage of imbedded nutrients than others, it was therefore concluded that harvesting at that stage is recommended.

A defoliation event in 2007 caused <italic>G</italic><sub>Cref</sub> to increase due to reduced leaf area and a possible increase in water availability. In <italic>Q. prinus</italic>, <italic>G</italic><sub>Cref</sub> quadrupled, while doubling in <italic>Q. velutina</italic>, and increasing by 50% in <italic>Q. coccinea</italic>. Tree mortality in 2008 led to higher <italic>G</italic><sub>Cref</sub> in the remaining <italic>Q. prinus</italic> but not in <italic>Q. velutina</italic> or <italic>Q. coccinea</italic>. Comparing light response curves of canopy conductance (<italic>G</italic><sub>Cref</sub>) and stomatal conductance (<italic>g</italic><sub>S</sub>) derived from gas-exchange measurements showed marked differences in behavior. Canopy <italic>G</italic><sub>Cref</sub> failed to saturate under ambient light conditions whereas leaf-level <italic>g</italic><sub>S</sub> saturated at 1,200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. The results presented here emphasize the differential responses of leaf and canopy-level conductance to saturating light conditions and the effects of various disturbances (drought, defoliation, and mortality) on the carbon and water balance of an oak-dominated forest.</p>",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3355680/,10.3389/fpls.2011.00015,english,2011,293–-301,1,,Karina Vera Rosa Schfer,Frontiers in Plant Science,"New Jersey Pine Barrens,defoliation,light,sap-flux,vapor pressure deficit",Frontiers Research Foundation
